# asyncio misty robot REST API

##### WIP

- almost fully featured
- testing in progress with a field trial version
- will always remain public

##### installation
- use python 3.7
- should be able to install with just `pip3 install git+https://github.com/acushner-xaxis/misty_py.git`
- run `jupyter console`, import the api, and then, from there you can do things like `help(MistyAPI)`
